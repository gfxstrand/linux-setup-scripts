Linux setup scripts
===================

This repository contains files and scripts required to set up a new Linux
system to my liking.  Important configuration files are contained in the
main folder and the distro folders contain scripts (most of which should be
run as root) that set the system up for a particular task.

This little project has greatly decreased the amount of time required to
get a new Linux install ready for my workflow.
